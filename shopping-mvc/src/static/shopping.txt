Line 1 calls a method called document.addEventListener which has two parameters
'DOMContentLoaded' and the function (event), it means when the global page (DOM)
is being loaded take the parameter called function.


Line 2 creates a variable called inputBox which has a value with a method type called
get Element by id, it has only one parameter that we declare it inside the string.


Line 3 creates a variable called shoppingList which has a value with a method type called
document.querySelector (querySelector goes and take directly take the Element which we are
putting inside the string, that means we don't need to give an id for our Element
in this case), it has only one parameter that we declare it inside the string.


Line 4 same as Line 3


Line 6 we have a variable called addItemButton which we call with a method that contains
two parameters ('click' and function (event)).


Line 7 we use the if expression or statement which we give a specific condition for calling
a method, it means (whenever our inputBox.value which includes also the .trim()
is not equal to '' (empty sting) go and call following method or functions)


Line 8 we are appending the function called creatNewListItem which creates us the
li element which contains the span and button elements
to our variable called shoppingList.


Line 9 we put the empty string ('') as the value for our variable called inputBox.


Line 10 we activate the disable status(attribute) for our variable called
addItemButton('button')
by giving the value true.

Line 11 we close our if statement by putting the right curly bracket.


Line 12 we call the method focus for our variable called inputBox.


Line 13 we close the function by curly bracket and closing the method (add.EventListener)
with parentheses and semicolon.


Line 15 we have a variable called inputBox which we call with a method (addEventListener)
that contains two parameters ('keyup' and function (event)).


Line 16 = Line 7
ATTENTION! If javascript read our value inside the parenthesis as a true value then it will
run our if statement otherwise it will jump up over our if expression.


Line 17 = Line 10

Line 18 we declare another if expression which means if the value for our property called
event.key is going to be equal to the string ('Enter') go and run the if statement.


Line 19 = Line 8


Line 20 = Line 9


Line 21 the if expression which is opened on line 18 is now closed.


Line 22 the if expression which is opened on line 16 is now closed.


Line 23 = Line 7 but only if the value is equal to ''(empty string).


Line 24 = Line 10


Line 25 the if expression which is opened on line 23 is now closed.


Line 26 = Line 13


Line 28 = Line 12

Line 29 we close the function by curly bracket and closing the method (add.EventListener)
with parentheses and semicolon which took place on the first code line.


Line 31 we declare our function called createNewListItem which contains one parameter
called ItemName


Line 32, 33, 35 we create 3 variables which create elements called (li, span and button).


Line 34, 36 we create values for our span and button elements.


Line 37 = Line 6 (used only for a different variable)


Line 38 is Outputs a message to the Web Console that modify, whenever a function is being
called before our console.log it shows up the message(the value as a parameter for our
console.log) on our web console.


Line 39 we are gonna add the method .remove() to our variable called listItem.


Line 40 closed the function from line 31.


From line 42 to 45 using the method .appendChild() to add the elements or text inside elements.


Line 46 whenever javascript reach this point that shows up something like return list;
it means go back and read the code on line 32 which is an element called li.
