      <h1>Recipe of: Pasta</h1>

      <p>&quot;This recipe was given to me as part of a wedding gift
        recipe collection from a very dear friend It is rich, aromatic,
        flavorful and makes A LOT. So please grab the biggest pot you can
        find I mean REALLY BIG. Extra sauce freezes well for future pasta
        dishes.&quot;</p>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Boil water in a large pot. To make sure <b>pasta</b>
                doesn'stick together, at least 4 quarts of water for
                every pound of <b>noodles</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Salt the water with at least a tablespoon—more is fine. The
                salty water adds flavor to the <b>pasta</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Add <b>pasta</b>...</p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Test the <b>pasta</b> by tasting it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

          <h3>What does it meant to be allergic to pasta? </h3>
          <p> Technically, what it means if someone is really “allergic to
              pasta” is that they suffer actual allergic reaction when they
              eat pasta. The reality is that they probably aren’t allergic to
              “pasta” but they are allergic to some ingredient IN the pasta.
              It could wheat, gluten, eggs or maybe something else depending
              on how the pasta is made. </p>

  Servings : 4 Prep Time : 10m Cook Time : 30m Ready In : 40m
Ingredients
110 g onions
3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
900 g best minced beef or lamb
2 tsp paprika
½ tsp turmeric
1 egg
½ tsp ground black pepper
¼ cup butter, melted (for brushing over the kababs after grilling)
1 tsp salt
Method
Step 1
Finely chop the onion in the food processor. Transfer to a sieve and press on it with a spoon to drain all the liquid.

Step 2
Mix the meat and onion pulp with the rest of the ingredients and knead with your fingers

Step 3
Continue mixing well with the hand until the mixture becomes sticky. Divide the meat into 8-10 equal balls.

Step 4
Then wet your hand with water and mould the mixture round kebab skewers to form kebabs about 10 cm long and 2.5 cm in diameter.

Step 5
Press on to the skewers firmly so that they will hold. Smooth the kebabs carefully with your wet hand. Press the meat between your thumb and index finger to make several indentations about 1 inch apart.

Step 6
Preheat the grill. Grill the kebabs under a high heat.

Step 7
When they are brown on both sides, remove carefully from the skewers and serve on one of the breads.

Step 8
Sprinkle with a little salt and black or red pepper.

Step 9
Narrow skewers work better than wide ones for the vegetables. The vegetables take longer to get ready, so if there is enough room on the grill start with the vegetables and halfway through grilling add the kabab skewers. If the space is limited, grill the vegetables first and keep them warm until Kababs are done.
