      <h1>Recipe of: Bolani</h1>

      <img src="bolani1-575x262.jpg" alt="Spaghetti" >

      <p>&quot;Bolani is a traditional Afghani flatbread stuffed and baked with either
        spinach, pumpkin, red potato, or green lentil filling. Bolani is usually
        served warm and as a side-dish, appetizer, Hors d'œuvre, or even as a
        main dish. It is the perfect diet food because not only are they low in
        carbohydrates, calories, and fat, they are high in nutrition such as
        protein, fiber, and vitamins. Bolanis are also ideal for vegans or those
        looking for healthy alternatives to meat products.&quot;</p>

          <h3>Method</h3>

          <p>We need <b>half an hour</b> to cook Bolani</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Dough:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><h4>Step 1</h4></li>
            <li><p>Mix flour and salt together. Gradually (while mixing) add in water and oil
                  until dough forms a ball. If the dough is too dry, add more water one
                  tablespoon at a time.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Step 2</h4></li>
            <li><p>Knead dough for 10 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Step 3</h4></li>
            <li><p>Place dough in lightly oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and let rest for one hour.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Filling:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><h4>Step 1</h4></li>
              <li><p>Scrub potatoes clean, place in a pot, cover by 2 inches with cold water, add
                    a good pinch of salt, and bring to a boil over high heat.</p></li>
              <li><h4>Step 2</h4></li>
              <li><p>After boiling for 20 minutes, check to see if the potatoes are done by poking
                      them with a skewer. The skewer should easily pierce through the center of the
                      potato. Try not to check the potatoes too much, as the holes allow water to
                      seep into the potatoes as they cook. Smaller potatoes may get done sooner
                      than larger ones.</p></li>
              <li><h4>Step 3</h4></li>
              <li><p>Once the potatoes are done, drain them and let sit for 5-10 minutes.</p></li>
              <li><h4>Step 4</h4></li>
              <li><p>Peel and quarter the potatoes. Mash with 2 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper.
                    Try to get this as smooth as possible, but keep in mind having some lumps is ok.</p></li>
              <li><h4>Step 5</h4></li>
              <li><p>Add in cilantro and scallions, continue mashing to combine.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>

          <h3>Assembling and cooking the bolani:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><h4>Step 1</h4></li>
              <li><p>Take a portion of the dough (about the size of a small apple) and roll it into
                    a smooth ball.</p></li>

              <li><h4>Step 2</h4></li>
              <li><p>Spread some flour onto your surface, and roll the ball with a rolling pin.
                    The dough should be as thin as a tortilla and have a 10-12 inch diameter.
                    The thinner, the better!</p></li>

              <li><h4>Step 3</h4></li>
              <li><p>Spread a little more than 1/4 c of the filling on one half of the dough,
                    leaving about 1/4 inch border around the rim.</p></li>

              <li><h4>Step 4</h4></li>
              <li><p>Fold the dough in half over the filling and press to seal. If necessary,
                    continue pressing and flattening the bolani to remove any excess air inside
                    the pocket.</p></li>

              <li><h4>Step 5</h4></li>
              <li><p>Heat 1/4 c olive oil in a pan. The oil should be hot enough that the bolani
                    sizzles when placed in the pan. Brown the bolani, two at a time, until golden
                    and crispy on both sides. This will only take a couple minutes on each side.</p></li>

              <li><h4>Step 6</h4></li>
              <li><p>Place cooked bolani on a paper towel or plate as they finish. Add more oil to
                    your pan as needed while you cook the rest.</p></li>

              <li><h4>Step 7</h4></li>
              <li><p>Serve warm with a simple yogurt sauce of plain yogurt, garlic, dill,
                  coriander, and salt.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
