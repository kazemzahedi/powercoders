        <h1>Recipe of: Pasta</h1>

        <img src="spaghetti.jpg" alt="Spaghetti" >

        <p>&quot;This recipe was given to me as part of a wedding gift
          recipe collection from a very dear friend It is rich, aromatic,
          flavorful and makes A LOT. So please grab the biggest pot you can
          find I mean REALLY BIG. Extra sauce freezes well for future pasta
          dishes.&quot;</p>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Boil water in a large pot. To make sure <b>pasta</b>
                doesn'stick together, at least 4 quarts of water for
                every pound of <b>noodles</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Salt the water with at least a tablespoon—more is fine. The
                salty water adds flavor to the <b>pasta</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

          <h3>What does it meant to be allergic to pasta? </h3>
          <p> Technically, what it means if someone is really “allergic to
              pasta” is that they suffer actual allergic reaction when they
              eat pasta. The reality is that they probably aren’t allergic to
              “pasta” but they are allergic to some ingredient IN the pasta.
              It could wheat, gluten, eggs or maybe something else depending
              on how the pasta is made. </p>
